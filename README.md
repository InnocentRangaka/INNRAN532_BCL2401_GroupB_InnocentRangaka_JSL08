# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management


his repository implements a singleton pattern for managing a single instance of a BankBranch class, demonstrating the singleton pattern usage for managing branch information and ensuring that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. For our banking system, let's use the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information.

## Features:

* Manages branch information (name, address)
* Singleton pattern ensures a single instance of BankBranch
* Methods for retrieving and setting branch information

## Additional Features:

* setBranchInfo method to set new branch information (name, address)
* getBranchName, getBranchAddress, and setBranchInfo methods provide access and modification of branch details.

The code demonstrates creating multiple instances of BankBranch and verifying that they refer to the same object due to the singleton implementation. The code examples, demonstrates usage and verifies singleton behaviour.
